### **Project: JSON-RPC Server in Golang for Ethereum**  

This project builds a **JSON-RPC server in Golang** to interact with Ethereum blockchain nodes. It allows users to:  
✅ Fetch blockchain data (latest block, wallet balance)  
✅ Call smart contract functions (like `balanceOf` in ERC-20 tokens)  
✅ Act as a middleware between clients and Ethereum nodes
